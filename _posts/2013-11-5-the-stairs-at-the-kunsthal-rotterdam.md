stairs
------
architecture is all about rules of thumb. kitchen counters are 36 inches above the ground. residential doorways are 6 feet 8 inches tall, while commercial doors tend to be 7 feet tall. stair treds are 11 inches deep, and risers are 7 inches tall. These rules of thumb, [and while they make architecture a very boring practice](https://medium.com/editors-picks/a844ec3343da "What Starbucks Gets that Architects Don't"), they also make for consistant and predictible experiences. when these best practices aren't used, bad things happen. 

about the stairs at the kunsthal
--------------------------------
on our way to rotterdam, i learned of a rumour (rumour because i can not validate it with nearly 90 seconds of active googling). the main staircase at the kunsthal in rotterdam were intentionally designed to suck. rem koolhaus, the dutch architect and renouned asshole is said to have designed the stairs to be difficult to navigate. the tread length is longer than an average stair-climbing stride, but shorter than two. so every step you climb requires an akward half step before you move on to the next. 

designing a bad experience
--------------------------
so maybe there are a few reasons one might want to create a bad experience, right?

to be a dick. thats the easy one. in the case of rem koolhaus at the rotterdam kunsthal, maybe thats it. but what if its more than that? 

a designer could create an enormously elaborate staircase. he could spend years crafting every single detail. a team of artisans could bring this vision to life, piecing this work of art together one piece at a time. people would notice *that* staircase. they would talk about it. they would study it in academia for years to come. a designer could do all of that work to get you to notice his staircase, or he could just lengthen the treads. 

making an experience a *bad* experience is a way to get a user, or museum visitor, to be more aware of his or her surroundings. Breaking that 7":11" rule above makes stairs harder to navigate, and therefore, more dangerous. 

traffic engineer hans monderman [famously made a crowded, dangerous intersection much safer](http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/essays/traffic-guru "The Traffic Guru | Wilson Quarterly") and friendlier (for drivers and pedestrians) by removing all signs, lights and signals. this drastic move made people perceive the intersection as *more dangerous,* which made people *more careful.*

so, wait...
-----------
is there a time when a designer *should* create a bad experience? maybe.

not to make a point, to stick it to an asshole client, or to spite an unknown user. 

but what about when we need to get a user's attention? what if we need to draw focus to a specific aspect of a design? so maybe intentionally creating a negitive experience can raise awareness and actually create a better overall experience.
