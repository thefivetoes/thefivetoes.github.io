hi

hey guys, im going to start this blog. its not that i think i have a lot to talk about or that i am a total expert at anything in particular. im also pretty sure that i am not going to be very good at it. but i read [this blog post about blogging](http://www.garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/) a while back and i couldn't stop thinking about it. seems like a good enough reason.

focus
-----
or rather, a lack of focus. 

originally this was going to (partially) be a learning experience using [expression engine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine). i've heard some good things about it, and have been meaning to check it out. but using a powerful CMS like that seems sort of overkill for a tiny little blog. so i decided on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is a static site generator. i will talk more about that in a future post. 

before i started to write this first post, i heard about [ghost](http://ghost.org/features/), which is a nodejs blogging platform. that also seems like maybe a bit of overkill, but its a little intriguing. it sounds like fun but we will see what happens. 

since i don't really have any goals, its hard to say what this could become. it is likely that it will start as one thing, say a blog about user experience, and then become something completely different. i think thats a good thing. right? 

where to now
------------
i am currently making a bunch of updates to a tiny little iOS app. i don't really know much about what i am doing (i have messed around with a bit of objective-c, but never anything for production). i am kind of having a blast getting my head into it, so there might be more talk of that in the future.

in the near future, i will be speaking about emerging technology trends at a [travel and tourism technology forum](http://www.destinationmarketing.org/technology-finance-operations-forum-0). this will be the first time i give this presentation and there aren't a lot of people talking about this stuff, so its pretty exciting. 

during the week, i manage a ux team of 5 designers and developers at a digital marketing agency. that is probs going to come up a lot. also front end web development, responsive design, and all of that junk.

a few months ago, i was part of an open source, nodejs [voting/polling platform](https://github.com/thundertech/tt-vote-hack) thing. it never really went anywhere (it really wasn't *supposed* to go anywhere), but if i find time i might pick it back up and launch it. maybe.

who knows. lets just see where this goes, k?
