- intro about process
- hermes intro
  - the entire creation process 24 months, etc
  - screen printing process
- the problem
  - supply vs demand, can not make enough
  - this seems like intentional scarcity
  - willingness to NOT make enough
    - sacrifice quality
    - everything is overseen by the house
    - creating more would limit this
- a quality brand (before a luxury brand)  
  - desire for perfection
  - attention to detail
