hi

hey guys, im going to start this blog. its not that i think i have a lot to talk about, or that i am a total expert at this or that. im also pretty sure that i am not going to be very good at it. but all that aside, i read [this blog post about blogging](http://www.garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/) a while back and i couldn't stop thinking about it. 

as of right now, i don't really have any particular goals for any of this. that can maybe come later. if it doesn't, thats probably fine too. 

- on focus
or rather, on a lack of focus. first, this was going to (partially) be a learning experience using [expression engine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine). i've heard some good things about it, and have been meaning to check it out. but maybe using a powerful CMS like that is sort of overkill for a blog. so i decided on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is a static site generator. more on that in a future post. 

before i even wrote this first post, i heard about [ghost](http://ghost.org/features/), which is a nodejs blogging platform. that also seems like maybe a bit of overkill, but its a little intriguing. we will see what happens.

since i don't really have any goals, its hard to say what this could become. it is likely that it will start as one thing, say a blog about user experience, and then become something about front end web development. and then it could change into a nodejs blog. thats a good thing. 

where to now
------------
i am currently making a bunch of updates to a tiny little iOS app. i don't really know much about what i am doing (i have messed around with a bit of objective-c, but never anything for production). i am kind of having a blast getting my head into it, so there might be more talk of that in the future.

later this month, i will be speaking about emerging technology trends at a [travel and tourism technology forum](http://www.destinationmarketing.org/technology-finance-operations-forum-0). this will be the first time i give this presentation and there aren't a lot of people talking about this stuff.

during the week i manage a ux team of 5 at a digital marketing agency. that is probs going to come up a lot. a lot. also front end web development, responsive design, blah blah blah. 

 a few months ago, i was part of an open source, nodejs [voting/polling platform](https://github.com/thundertech/tt-vote-hack) thing. it never really went anywhere (it really wasn't *supposed* to go anywhere), but if i find time i might pick it back up and launch it. maybe.
