            <p>hi, im justin. i am a creative technologist by night, and the manager of a ux team in cleveland by day. it hasnt always been that way.</p>
            <p>my formal background (er, college degree) is in architecture. after school, i took some time off, to pursue a job doing 3d modeling and animation. i started doing some web design, which turned into web development, which turned into user experience design and strategy.</p>
            <p>let's be honest, i get distracted easily. recent distractions have resulted in me reaching beyond day-to-day work stuff into: iOS app development, nodejs, public speaking, openframeworks, kinect development, unity development, web gl and leap motion development.</p>
            <p>my portfolio lives at <a href="http://jws.io/?utm_source=thefivetoes&utm_medium=about%20page&utm_campaign=blog">jws.io</a>. you can talk to me on twitter: @thefivetoes, or if you dont like that you can email me: justin@jws.io</p>
